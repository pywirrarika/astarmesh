This work is an implementation of the A* algorithm applyed on a Mesh graph, ideal for a Game Engine. A Skiplist was used for the close list, combined with a array. I hope it can be usefull for future works.

To install use:

./configure
make
sudo make install

If you got this code from a git repo, use autoreconf --install before enter the ./configure step.
